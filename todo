TODO
- Perhaps MemoryLifetimes shouldn't support nesting?
- Should array_template include the capability to add a header struct?
- Implement the "handle recognizer" Parser interface
- Implement at least SLR grammars


DONE
- Enhance token streams to record symbols / strings / ints too
- Use that as the only interface from ellesmere.c
- "Block" should push a token block, not a token stream
- Everything should use a MemoryBatch (MemorySource?)

RAMBLINGS
- Must reimplement globals.  Dispatcher needs to be involved I think.  If some other dude replaces them with their values, dispatcher never sees the tokens and can't tell the arity.
- Maybe a symbol table per scope?  Indexed by the same symbols?
- Hmm, how can the dispatcher push a new value for a symbol??
- Gotta fix things so dispatcher is in charge of replacing symbols with value (ie. nullary functions in effect)
- How does "reduce" remove the token and leave just the args on stack?
